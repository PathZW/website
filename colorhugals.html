      <p>
       An ambient light sensor is a little chip that you’ve certainly got in your
       tablet, most probably in your phone and you might even have one in your
       laptop if you’re lucky.
       Ambient light sensors let us change the panel brightness so that you can
       still see your screen when it’s sunny outside, but we can dim it when the
       ambient room light level is lower to save power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not many laptops have ambient light sensors; of the ones that do the driver
       support is really bad and they often return garbage values.
       As hardware support is so bad, we’ve not got any software that actually
       uses the ALS hardware effectively.

      <p>
       I've spent a bit of time over the last few months designing a small
       OpenHardware USB device that acts as a ambient light sensor.
       It’s basically an uncalibrated ColorHug1 design with a less
       powerful processor, but speaking a subset of same protocol so all the
       firmware update and test tools just work out of the box.
       The device sleeps between readings, so only consumes a tiny amount of
       power.
       With hardware that we know works out of the box, we can work on the
       software integration.

      <p>
       The sensor itself is a very small (12x22mm) printed circuit board that
       inserts directly into a spare USB socket.
       It only sticks out about 9mm from the edge of the laptop as most of the
       PCB actually gets pushed into the USB slot.

      <p>
       ColorHugALS can currently control the backlight when running the
       <code>colorhug-backlight</code> utility.
       The Up/Down header buttons do the same as the hardware BrightnessUp and
       BrightnessDown keys.
       You can still set the absolute backlight so you're in control of the
       absolute level right now, the ALS modifying the level either side of what
       you just set in the coming minutes.
       The brightness is modified using a exponential moving average, which
       makes the brightness changes smooth and unnoticeable on hardware with
       enough brightness levels.
      </p>

      </center>
      <p>
       We also use the brightness value at start to be what you consider
       "normal" so the algorithm tries to stay out of the way.
       When we've got some defaults that work well and has been tested the aim is
       to push this into <code>gnome-control-center</code> and
       <code>gnome-settings-daemon</code> for GNOME 3.18 so that no additional
       software is required.﻿

      <p>
       The ColorHugALS device <b>CANNOT</b> be used to calibrate your screen
       and so is only suitable for ambient light measurements.
