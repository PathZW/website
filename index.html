<h1>Introducing the ColorHug</h1>

    The ColorHug is an open source display colorimeter.
    It allows you to calibrate your screen for accurate color matching.

<a name="what-is"></a>
<p>
The ColorHug is a small plastic box that is held on the screen and plugged
into a spare USB port on the computer.

<p>Have you ever looked at a photo like this and wondered why it does not look the same on your screen?</p>

<p>
It's probably because the LCD display on your computer has never been
calibrated. This means colors can look washed-out, tinted with certain shades
or with different color casts.
</p>

<p>
About 2 years ago I began working on color management in Linux.
It soon became apparent that there was no integrated color management system.  
The color management support which did exist was often disabled by default in many applications.
I have worked hard to make calibrating displays easy ever since.
It is my goal to make color management accessable to end users.
The hardware for color managing screens was bulky, slow and expensive.
With a background in electronics, I thought I could create a device which was smaller, faster and cheaper.
</p>

<p>
Using the ColorHug it takes about a minute to take several hundred
measurements from which the client software creates an ICC color profile.
This color profile file can then be saved and used to make colors look
correct on your monitor.

</p>
The above table demonstrates how the Hughski ColorHug compares to other
similar products on the market.
The key advantages are the speed at which it measures samples, the open
source licence which means you can access and change the code, and the
lower price.
The low price is achieved from using commercial off-the-shelf components
and free software.
</p>
<p>
 The Hughski ColorHug packs a huge amount of functionality into such a
 small size. It's just 32mm wide, 43mmm tall and 21mm deep.
</p>

<a name="how-it-works"></a>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>
The Colorhug contains a color sensor with 9 pixels, 3 red, 3 blue and 3 green.
Each different color sensor effectively counts photons, and so by
counting the number of photons there are for each sensor we can work out
the true color shown on the screen.
This photon count is converted to an XYZ color value by the processor on
the ColorHug and the set of measurements can be processed into an ICC
file.
The colorhug takes just 16 seconds to sample 400 colors and performs an
order of magnitude faster than it's competitors.
</p>

<p>
There are <b>no Microsoft Windows or Apple OSX drivers</b> included with
this product.
You can use the LiveCD sent with the device on any modern PC or use the
built in software available in Fedora 16 or newer.
<!--
There are plans to get the ColorHug working with Argyllcms, and this
project provides windows binaries.
