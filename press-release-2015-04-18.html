FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Hughski Ltd announces new OpenHardware ColorHug2 device
Monday January 20th, 2015

London, UK — Hughski Limited announced this week that it is producing a new ColorHug2 device that is able to accurately profile displays. It is planned an upgrade to the original ColorHug device that was only capable of profiling some types of display.

Hughski Limited has announced this new product after the success of the original ColorHug device. The new product is based on the JENCOLOR sensor from MAZeT. All electrical, hardware, bootloader and firmware is available for free with OpenHardware-approved licences.

This device will allow artists, animators and photographers who use Linux to have absolute confidence in the colors that are shown on the screen and on paper.

More information is expected to be released in due time, but some initial specifications have been listed on the website. Richard is asking anyone interested in purchasing a device to visit the ColorHug2 page <a href="hughski.com/colorhug2.html">here</a>. The expected recommended retail price is £75 with free worldwide shipping.

About Hughski Limited:

Hughski is a small UK private limited company founded in 2011 and owned by Richard Hughes. The ColorHug is designed and built in London, England.

       London, UK &mdash; Hughski Limited announced this week that it is producing a
       new ColorHugALS device for ambient light backlight brightness control.
       An ambient light sensor is a chip that you’ve certainly got in your
       tablet, most probably in your phone, but very few laptops include one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ambient light sensors let us change the panel brightness automatically
       so that people can still see the screen when it’s sunny outside, but
       reducing the brightness when the ambient room light is lower to save power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hughski Limited has announced this new product due to the continued
       success of the original ColorHug device.
       The new applications are compatible with the existing ColorHug1 device,
       and the ColorHugALS is compatible with the existing applications.
