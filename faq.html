<a name="leds"><h2>What do the LEDs mean</h2></a>
<p>
There are two leds in the ColorHug, one green and one red.
The LEDs are used in the following way:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Both LEDs flash on then off for a split second when the hardware is plugged in.</li>
<li>The green LED flashes quickly three times when the sensor is locked.</li>
<li>The red and green LEDs flash slowly alternately when the device is in bootloader mode and needs reflashing with new firmware.</li>
<li>The red LED displays morse code in the event of a fatal device error.</li>
</ul>

<a name="suckers"><h2>Why do I have to hold the device against the screen</h2></a>
<p>
Suckers have been known to damage LCD screens by lifting off the top layer
of glass.
I can't risk this kind of damage, as there's simply not enough profit in
each ColorHug to refund the repair costs of displays.
When calibrating each ColorHug I use a large rubber band to hold the device
to the screen. This works suprisingly well.
If you've got a good idea that doesn't involve suckers, please let us know!

<a name="crapcal"><h2>Why is my screen "wrong" after calibrating</h2></a>
<p>
If your screen differs much from the idealized sRGB that the ColorHug
is calibrated against then the calibration result may be far from ideal.
This may happen if you are using an expensive LED display, or a
minature embedded LCD with low bit depth DAC.
</p>
<p>
To fix this, you just need to load a correction matrix that's close to
your display technology using the <code>colorhug-ccmx</code> GUI program.
At the moment there are not many display types, but this will increase
when those in the ColorHug community with a photospectrometer start
contributing matrices. It's a typical chicken and egg problem, although
if you join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/colorhug-users">colorhug-users</a>
google group I'll announce new matrices when they are uploaded.
</p>
<p>
If you've already got a photospectrometer (or can borrow one for a few
hours) then please follow the directions <a href="calibrate.html">here</a>.
If you contribute the resuling CCMX file back to us, we can share it with
other users and improve their calibration result too.
I'm especially interested in odd display types, as these will be very
different from the calibration target.
