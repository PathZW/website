      <a name="how-does-it-work"></a><h2>How does the device work?</h2>
      <p>
      The ColorHug contains a color sensor with 64 pixels - 16 red, 16 blue,
      16 green, and 16 clear.
      Each different color sensor effectively counts photons, and so by
      counting the number of photons there are for each sensor we can work out
      the true color shown on the screen.
      This photon count is converted to an XYZ color value by the processor on
      the ColorHug and the set of measurements can be processed into an
      <acronym title="International Color Consortium">ICC</acronym> file.

      <a name="openhardware"></a><h2>Is the ColorHug OpenHardware?</h2>
      <p>
      We consider ColorHug an OpenHardware project, although there's no formal
      definition of what makes an 'official' OpenHardware project at the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
      The licences chosen for the different parts of the project allow you to copy,
      remix, redesign or repurpose the hardware or even build a device from scratch
      from the hardware plans and the freely downloadable firmware.
      There are no patents or design registrations, nor any intellectual property
      that has to be licenced.
      </p>
      <p>
      There is one small limitation. You can build your own ColorHug device
      and call it a <i>ColorHug</i>, but you cannot use the three color logo as it is a
      trademark of Hughski Limited.
      This was done after taking legal advice to help preserve the community, and to
      stop a company selling a substandard <i>official</i> device that would tarnish
      the brand and make Hughski Limited look bad.
      </p>

      The above table demonstrates how the Hughski ColorHug compares to other
      similar products on the market.
      The key advantages are the speed at which it measures samples, the open
      source licence which means you can access and change the code, and the
      low price.

      Packages normally arrive in the UK and western Europe within three days
      and eastern Europe within five working days.
      Delivery to the rest of the world usually takes between five to seven
      working days although it can take a lot longer than this for some counties.
      </p>

      <hr/>
      <a name="leds"></a><h2>What do the LEDs mean?</h2>
      <p>
      There are two LEDs in the ColorHug, one green and one red.
      The LEDs are used in the following way:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>Both LEDs flash on then off for a split second when the hardware is plugged in.</li>
      <li>The green LED flashes quickly three times when the sensor is locked.</li>
      <li>The red and green LEDs flash slowly alternately when the device is in bootloader mode and needs reflashing with new firmware.</li>
      <li>The red LED displays morse code in the event of a fatal device error.</li>
      </ul>

      <hr/>
      <a name="crapcal"></a><h2>Why is my screen "wrong" after calibrating?</h2>
      <p>
      If your screen differs much from the idealized sRGB that the ColorHug
      is calibrated against then the calibration result may be far from ideal.
      This may happen if you are using an expensive LED display, or a
      miniature embedded LCD with low bit depth
      <acronym title="Digital-to-analog converter">DAC</acronym>.
      </p>
      <p>
      To fix this, you just need to load a correction matrix that's close to
      your display technology using the <code>colorhug-ccmx</code> GUI program.
      At the moment there are not many display types, but this will increase
      when those in the ColorHug community with a photospectrometer start
      contributing matrices. It's a typical chicken and egg problem, although
      if you join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/colorhug-users" target="_blank">colorhug-users</a>
      google group I'll announce new matrices when they are uploaded.
      </p>
      <p>
      If you've already got a photospectrometer (or can borrow one for a few
      hours) then please follow the directions <a href="calibrate.html">here</a>.
      If you contribute the resulting
      <acronym title="colorimeter correction matrix">CCMX</acronym> file back to us, we can share it with
      other users and improve their calibration result too.
      I'm especially interested in odd display types, as these will be very
      different from the calibration target.
      </p>

      <hr/>
      <a name="remote-disable"></a><h2>What is lost-or-stolen mode?</h2>
      <p>
      When we send the ColorHug device to you, we give you the choice of
      postage methods, as we understand a lot of people don't want to pay
      &pound;9.90 postage for an item that only costs &pound;60.00.
      Using untracked postage means that packages can get lost during tracking,
      and due to the distance selling regulations of the UK, any lost packages
      have to be refunded by the seller to the buyer.
      </p>
      <p>
      In order to deter unscrupulous buyers, any packages that
      are registered as lost or stolen will have the ColorHug devices added
      to a blacklist.
      This means that anybody trying to update the firmware on a device that
      is registered as lost or stolen will have the hardware disabled.
      Serial numbers will not be added to this list for any other reason.
      </p>

      <hr/>
      <a name="firmware-update-data"></a><h2>What data is transmitted to hughski.com?</h2>
      <p>
      If you choose to update the firmware on your device, the <code>colorhug-flash</code>
      program contacts <code>hughski.com</code> and downloads the list of all
      the firmware updates. When it does that, the following data is sent to
      the server:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>Your IP address</li>
      <li>The current version of the firmware</li>
      <li>The hardware version of the device</li>
      <li>The serial number of the device (e.g. #000337)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      We don't actually use this data for anything other than working out what
      firmware is available to you and any logs are automatically overwritten
      after 30 days.
      </p>
      <p>
      The <b>only</b> time any data is transfered to the server is when you
      update the firmware or download new CCMX matrices, and certainly not
      for each calibration or sample!
      </p>

      <hr/>
      <a name="erase-factory-cal"></a><h2>I've erased my factory calibration!</h2>
      <p>
      If you're got colorhug-client 0.1.4 or newer installed, just run
      <code>colorhug-ccmx</code> and you should be presented with the following
      dialog:
      </p>
      <img src="img/colorhug-ccmx-fix.png" class="centered" alt="[colorhug-ccmx screenshot]"/>
      <p>
      Then just click <code>Repair</code> and the device will be back to normal.
      </p>

      <hr/>
      <a name="payment-methods"></a><h2>What payment methods are accepted?</h2>
      <p>
      The preferred way of paying for a device is using PayPal as it's easy
      for me to track payments and issue refunds.
      If you've got ideological problems with PayPal, or would rather not
      use them, then email me when you get the offer to purchase a device
      and I'll give you my <acronym title="International Bank Account Number">IBAN</acronym>
      and <acronym title="Bank Identifier Code">BIC</acronym> numbers for a
      direct bank transfer.

      <a name="bugzilla"></a><h2>I've found a bug or missing feature, what do I do?</h2>
      <p>
      Just file a bug in our <a href="bugzilla/">Bugzilla</a> issue tracker.
      Be sure to write as much detail as possible in the bug report, for instance:
      </p>
      <ul>

      <a name="shipping"></a><h2>I sent money for a device over two weeks ago, where is it?</h2>
      <p>
      Normally shipping parcels to Europe takes about 4 working days, but has
      been known to take up to two weeks, especially to Italy for some reason.
      Shipping to Africa, Brazil and Russia is meant to take about one week,
      but it seems parcels seem to get lost for weeks at a time and then turn
      up without explanation.
      If the destination is the United States, then double check you've not got
      a letter from the post office about a held package that has to pay some
      kind of customs charge or sales tax.
      </p>
      <p>
      If you've been waiting over two weeks then email me and I can confirm
      the date I sent the parcel and the serial number.
      Our policy on lost or missing parcels is this (which is based on how
      quickly I can file a claim with the UK post office):
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>If the package was <i>signed-for</i> then we have to wait 6 weeks from the sent date</li>
      <li>If the package was not <i>signed-for</i> then we have to wait 12 weeks from the sent date</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      If the parcel has not arrived in the durations above, then I can either
      (at your choice) offer you a refund of the full amount via PayPal or
      send another parcel <b>to a different address</b>.
      If this second delivery also fails, then I can't attempt to send any more,
      and only a refund will be offered.
      </p>
      <p>
      If a refund is issued, or a replacement sent, then the original device
      can be disabled to stop any unscrupulous postal workers from putting
      the device on eBay. :)
      </p>

      <hr/>
      <a name="flashing-failed"></a><h2>Flashing failed, is my device now a brick!?</h2>
      <p>
      No.
      If the flashing failed (of if the new firmware is bad), the ColorHug
      device reverts to a safe startup mode.
      The bootloader is always loaded at every startup, and the firmware is
      only bootstrapped if it is marked as valid.
      The easiest way to tell if you are in bootloader mode is to
      <a href="#leds">look at the LEDs</a> or search for a line like this in
      <code>dmesg</code>:
      </p>
      <pre>
      [  276.933714] generic-usb 0003:04D8:F8DA.0003:
        hiddev0,hidraw0: USB HID v1.11 Device [Hughski Ltd. ColorHug (bootloader)]
      </pre>
      <p>
      The easiest thing to do is just to reattempt to update the flash, by
      running <code>colorhug-flash</code> again.
      If this again fails, just manually boot the firmware like this:
      </p>
      <pre>
      $ /usr/libexec/colorhug boot-flash
      $ /usr/libexec/colorhug set-flash-success 1
      </pre>

      <hr/>
      <a name="windows-and-osx"></a><h2>Does the device work on Windows or OS&nbsp;X?</h2>
      <p>
       The ColorHug can be used on Windows and Apple computers using the LiveCD
       and then copying the <code>.icc</code> profile to the destination operating system.
       I can't do native device drivers myself, although a few people have said
       informally they wanted to work on them.
       The device uses the USB <acronym title="Human interface device">HID</acronym>
       protocol, so no <i>digitally signed</i> device drivers should be
       required at all.

      <p>
       There are no plans to support this device on any version of Unix or
       any of the BSD variants.
       If somebody needs this then it would be quite easy for them to port the
       <a href="https://gitorious.org/colorhug/client/blobs/master/contrib/ch-usb.c">libusb-0.1 demo</a>
       to another Linux-like operating system although it would not be supported by us.

      <p>
       If you have an Mac older than 2006 you have an old
       <acronym title="Extensible Firmware Interface">EFI</acronym> on your system.
       You can not upgrade this and normal Linux distribution CDs will not work.
       Some distributions have been specially modified to work with this type
       of system.
       A special Ubuntu distribution exists for this hardware called
       <a href="http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/">Ubuntu x64_mac</a>
       and you can use the
       <a href="https://launchpad.net/~pmjdebruijn/+archive/gcm-colorhug/">Ubuntu PPA</a>
       to update to the newest firmware.

      <a name="projector"></a><h2>How do I use the ColorHug with a projector?</h2>
      <p>
      Shine the projector onto the ColorHug in a dark room from about
      1-2&nbsp;meters away so there is no shadow.
      Ensure the ColorHug's aperture is pointing straight towards the center
      of the colored patches.
      To increase the sensitivity of the ColorHug, you can remove the aperture
      hole assembly using a fingernail tucked between the two rubber grommits,
      although then the room will have to be completely dark.
      </p>

      <a name="need-env-var"></a><h2>Why does the ColorHug not work with ArgyllCMS?</h2>
      <p>
      To use the ColorHug with the ArgyllCMS tools on the command line ensure
      you have set <code>ENABLE_COLORHUG=1</code> as an environment variable.
      This is required because the ColorHug currently doesn't work reliably
      across all platforms ArgyllCMS supports.
      </p>
      <p>
      This is of course set automatically when using the graphical tools.

      <a name="software-versions"></a><h2>What are the minimum software versions?</h2>
      <p>
      If you're not using the LiveCD you need at least:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li><code>argyllcms</code> (Fedora) or <code>argyll</code> (Ubuntu) >= 1.4.0</li>
      <li><code>colord</code> >= 0.1.15</li>
      <li><code>colorhug-client</code> >= 0.1.4</li>
      <li><code>gusb</code> >= 0.1.2</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      If you're using GNOME, also add:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li><code>gnome-color-manager</code> >= 3.2.4</li>
      <li><code>gnome-control-center</code> >= 3.2.2</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      If you're using KDE, also add:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li><code>colord-kde</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      If you're using XFCE or another desktop environment then you can of
      course just install <code>colorhug-client</code> to update firmware
      and load CCMX files. If you want to use the calibration wizard you can
      either install the GNOME dependencies or install the very advanced
      program dispcalGUI, although we can't support that ourselves.

      <a name="red-shift"></a><h2>Why has my display got an obvious color shift after calibration?</h2>
      <p>
      Calibrating to a warmer temperature of D65 is going to look a lot more
      blue than is native for some displays.
      If the color shift is obviously really wrong, take a look at this
      <a href="http://blog.pcode.nl/2012/06/15/colorhug-red-shift-workaround/">
      excellent blog post</a> by Pascal.
      Usually selecting a closer CCMX in <code>colorhug-ccmx</code> is the solution.
      We're working on the firmware design, and the device accuracy for low
      light is going up all the time, but this is a problem that affects all
      colorimeter devices.

      <a name="measure-modes"></a><h2>What's the difference between measurement modes?</h2>
      <p>
      There are only two ways of measuring the output of a light-to-frequency
      device, measuring the pulse width or measuring the number of pulses over
      a set time.
      </p>
      <p>
      The simplest way is to measure the number of pulses in a set time interval.
      This works well when the light level is high so that the quantisation
      noise is small but does not work well for very dark patches.
      Although an adaptive algorithm is used (giving dark patches more time),
      this sample speed is typically half of the pulse-width mode.
      This mode is the only available mode on firmware versions 1.1.x.
      </p>
      <p>
      Averaging several pulse durations has the advantage that it can work
      down to 0.5&nbsp;Hz, but as the reading gets high (0.5&nbsp;KHz and above)
      the measured readings begin to have small aliasing errors introduced.
      This mode is default on firmware 1.2.0 and newer, although the modes can
      be switched at runtime.
      In all tests so far, the 'duration' mode has outperformed the 'frequency'
      mode when building profiles.
      </p>
      <p>
      The two modes produce the same absolute readings and should not alter
      the reported absolute XYZ readings.
