      <a name="ch1-ch2-what-changed"></a><h2>What was changed in ColorHug2?</h2>
      <p>
       The new ColorHug2 is different from the original ColorHug in four main ways:
      </p>
      <center>
       <a href="img/colorhug2-large.jpg">
        <img src="img/colorhug2.jpg" style="margin: 20px 20px">
       </a>
      </center>
      <ul>
      <li>
        The sensor has been upgraded from a $1 TAOS sensor to a $30
        <a href="http://www.mazet.de/en/products/jencolor">JENCOLOR</a> sensor
        from <a href="http://www.mazet.de/">MAZeT</a>.
        This produces a true XYZ reading and typically doesn't need a CCMX to
        get decent results on most consumer hardware.
        This was the #1 stumbling block for the initial ColorHug device, as
        anything outside <i>quite-close-to-sRGB</i> needed a correction matrix.
      </li>
      <li>
        The PCB now contains on-board SRAM so it can do latency, rise-fall and
        fall-rise measurements.
        This means we can do things like measuring the <b>true</b> latency delays
        on real CPU+GPU+display combinations.
        I'm expecting to use the hi-speed acquisition and storage capabilities
        for other exciting things in the future. 
      </li>
      <li>
        The PCB contains a temperature sensor to be able to compensate outside
        of the 20-40 &deg;C calibrated range.
        I've got this working in so much that it returns the right temperature,
        but the compensation code needs work.
        This will be addressed with future firmware updates.
      </li>
      <li>
        Microsoft Windows is now a supported platform, with the flash, CCMX and
        latency tools working as well there as they do in Linux.
        Calibration still has to be done in Linux, although I'm hoping to make
        that work in Windows too.
      </li>
      </ul>

      <a name="more-expensive"></a><h2>Why is the ColorHug2 more expensive than the original ColorHug?</h2>
      <p>
        The ColorHug2 is slightly more expensive than the original design.
        This is due to the increased component costs in the last 2 years,
        increased complexity of the design and also due to including free
        signed-for/tracked shipping in the base price.
        We're also shipping a 4GB LiveUSB to customers now, rather than the
        space-limited and slow LiveCD.
      </p>


      <hr/>
      <a name="buy-colorhug1"></a><h2>Can I still buy the original ColorHug?</h2>
      <p>
      Unfortunately no, we're a small company and can't afford to keep large
      amounts of stock.
      </p>

      <hr/>
      <a name="upgrade-colorhug1"></a><h2>Can upgrade a ColorHug to a ColorHug2?</h2>
      <p>
      Not really. Although the plastic casing is the same, the PCB contains many
      more ICs than the first version and the optics interface is different.
      Considering the PCB is the most expensive component to produce it wouldn't
      be cost effective for us to upgrade a device.
      Don't worry though, the original ColorHug devices are still supported as
      they have a large number of people using them every day.
      </p>

      <hr/>
      <a name="how-does-it-work"></a><h2>How does the device work?</h2>
      <p>
      The original ColorHug contained a simple color sensor with 64 pixels &mdash;
      16 red, 16 blue, 16 green, and 16 clear.
      The ColorHug2 device contains a much improved
      <a href="http://www.mazet.de/en/products/jencolor">JENCOLOR</a> sensor
      from <a href="http://www.mazet.de/">MAZeT</a> that returns true XYZ values.
      This XYZ color values are sent from the ColorHug to the host and the set
      of measurements are processed into an
      <acronym title="International Color Consortium">ICC</acronym> file.
      The gamma mismatch problem was the #1 stumbling block for the original
      ColorHug device, as anything outside <i>quite-close-to-sRGB</i> needed a
      correction matrix.

      <a name="openhardware"></a><h2>Is the ColorHug OpenHardware?</h2>
      <p>
      Yes! ColorHug is now officially certified open source hardware by
      <a href="http://certificate.oshwa.org/certification-directory/">OSHWA</a>.
      Our UID is <code>UK000001</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
      The licences chosen for the different parts of the project allow you to copy,
      remix, redesign or repurpose the hardware or even build a device from scratch
      from the hardware plans and the freely downloadable firmware.
      There are no patents or design registrations, nor any intellectual property
      that has to be licenced.
      </p>
      <p>
      There is one small limitation. You can build your own ColorHug device
      and call it a <i>ColorHug</i>, but you cannot use the three color logo as it is a
      trademark of Hughski Limited.
      This was done after taking legal advice to help preserve the community, and to
      stop a company selling a substandard <i>official</i> device that would tarnish
      the brand and make Hughski Limited look bad.

      The above table demonstrates how the Hughski ColorHug compares to other
      similar products on the market.
      The key advantages are the open source licences and open hardware design
      which means you can review and modify all aspects of the product,
      and of course the low price.

      <a name="device-not-working"></a><h2>What do I do if the device stops working?</h2>
      <ul>
       <li>Check the device is plugged in!</li>
       <li>Check <code>dmesg</code> to see if the device is detected, if so check the permissions on the USB device.</li>
       <li>Check the LEDs briefly flash when the device is plugged in.</li>
       <li>Use a different USB cable to the one supplied in order to check whether the cable is at fault.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       If the device does not work, or is otherwise faulty please
       <a href="mailto:colorhug@hughski.com">email us</a> for advice.
       If we agree that the ColorHug is faulty and you return it to us then you
       can request a full refund or a replacement device.
      </p>

      <hr/>
      <a name="shipping-cost"></a><h2>How much is shipping?</h2>
      <p>
      For ColorHug2, ColorHugALS and ColorHug+ worldwide tracked/signed-for
      postage is included in the cost of the device.
      </p>
      <p>
      Packages normally arrive in the UK and western Europe within three days
      and eastern Europe within five working days.
      Delivery to the rest of the world usually takes between five to seven
      working days although it can take a lot longer than this for some counties.
      </p>

      <hr/>
      <a name="leds"></a><h2>What do the LEDs mean?</h2>
      <p>
      There are two LEDs in the ColorHug, one green and one red.
      The LEDs are used in the following way:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>Both LEDs flash on then off for a split second when the hardware is plugged in.</li>
      <li>The green LED flashes quickly three times when the sensor is locked.</li>
      <li>The red and green LEDs flash slowly alternately when the device is in bootloader mode and needs reflashing with new firmware.</li>
      <li>The red LED displays morse code in the event of a fatal device error.</li>
      </ul>

      <hr/>
      <a name="matching-displays"></a><h2>Can I make my external display match my laptop screen?</h2>
      <p>
      You can certainly get close, but you really don't want to if you don't have to.
      Imagine buying a $45,000 Ferrari with a 2 liter engine, and another $70,000
      Ferrari with a 4 liter engine.
      You want <i>the performance to match between the two cars</i>.
      The only way to do this would be to make the 4 liter car much less powerful
      so that it matches the performance of the 2 liter car.
      In the context of display calibration you would be limiting the better screen to the
      range of colors the less expensive screen can display.
      </p>
      <p>
      There are also other issues for making the displays "match".
      Imagine if the laptop screen ouput approximately a red primary of 620nm,
      and the external screen output a primary of 630nm.
      You can't change the primary as it's due to the chemical composition of screen hardware.
      You can emulate different XYZ colors using color mixed from other channels,
      but you can mix colors to make a pink red a deep red.
      </p>
      <p>
      What you can do with a colorimeter is give each screen a similar whitepoint value,
      which gets you 90% the way there as your eyes are very sensitive to
      whitepoint <i>differences</i> (but not absolute values).
      The ColorHug software defauts to a D65 whitepoint, although you can choose
      a custom whitepoint using dispcalGUI.

      <a name="display-printer"></a><h2>Can I make my display match what is printed?</h2>
      <p>
      This is a complex problem indeed, and design companies pay tens of
      thousands of pounds trying to make this a reality.
      From a technical level, it's really really hard.
      Screens are outputting photons (additive, emissive), and the color is affected by
      things like the ambient level of lighting the room and even the color the
      room is painted affects the color you see.
      Paper depends on the color and spectra of the lighting you are using (subtractive, reflective) to
      view the printed sheet, the ink, the paper color, the paper quality, and
      many more things.
      I would suggest any one more interested in this difficult problem reads
      <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Real-World-Color-Management-Industrial-Strength/dp/0321267222">Real World Color Management</a>
      which explains a lot of these problems better than I ever can.
      </p>
      <p>
      One thing the ColorHug can do is fix your display so that at least we're
      more in control of the display side of the equation.
      It's not going to make the resulting edited hardcopies any <i>less</i> accurate,
      and will hopefully be more accurate. You can be sure of one thing,
      it's certainly never going to match perfectly. :)

      <a name="crapcal"></a><a name="colorcast"></a><h2>Why is my screen "wrong" after calibrating?</h2>
      <p>
      If your screen differs much from the idealized sRGB that the ColorHug
      is calibrated against then the calibration result may be far from ideal.
      This may happen if you are using an expensive LED display, or a
      miniature embedded LCD with low bit depth
      <acronym title="Digital-to-analog converter">DAC</acronym>.
      </p>
      <p>
      To fix this, you just need to load a correction matrix that's close to
      your display technology using the <code>colorhug-ccmx</code> GUI program.
      At the moment there are not many display types, but this will increase
      when those in the ColorHug community with a photospectrometer start
      contributing matrices. It's a typical chicken and egg problem, although
      if you join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/colorhug-users" target="_blank">colorhug-users</a>
      google group I'll announce new matrices when they are uploaded.
      </p>
      <p>
      If you've already got a photospectrometer (or can borrow one for a few
      hours) then please follow the directions <a href="calibrate.html">here</a>.
      If you contribute the resulting
      <acronym title="colorimeter correction matrix">CCMX</acronym> file back to us, we can share it with
      other users and improve their calibration result too.
      I'm especially interested in odd display types, as these will be very
      different from the calibration target.

      <p>
      Normally shipping parcels to Europe takes about 4 working days, but has
      been known to take up to two weeks, especially to Italy for some reason.
      Shipping to Africa, Brazil and Russia is meant to take about one week,
      but it seems parcels seem to get lost for weeks at a time and then turn
      up without explanation.
      If the destination is the United States, then double check you've not got
      a letter from the post office about a held package that has to pay some
      kind of customs charge or sales tax.
      </p>
      <p>
      If you've been waiting over two weeks then email me and I can confirm
      the date I sent the parcel and the serial number.
      Our policy on lost or missing parcels is this (which is based on how
      quickly I can file a claim with the UK post office):
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>If the package was <i>signed-for</i> then we have to wait 6 weeks from the sent date</li>
      <li>If the package was not <i>signed-for</i> then we have to wait 12 weeks from the sent date</li>

      If the parcel has not arrived in the durations above, then I can either
      (at your choice) offer you a refund of the full amount via PayPal or
      send another parcel <b>to a different address</b>.
      If this second delivery also fails, then I can't attempt to send any more,

      <a name="flashing-failed"></a><h2>Flashing failed, is my device now a brick!?</h2>
      <p>
      No.
      If the flashing failed (of if the new firmware is bad), the ColorHug
      device reverts to a safe startup mode.
      The bootloader is always loaded at every startup, and the firmware is
      only bootstrapped if it is marked as valid.
      The easiest way to tell if you are in bootloader mode is to
      <a href="#leds">look at the LEDs</a> or search for a line like this in
      <code>dmesg</code>:
      </p>
      <pre>
      [  276.933714] generic-usb 0003:04D8:F8DA.0003:
        hiddev0,hidraw0: USB HID v1.11 Device [Hughski Ltd. ColorHug (bootloader)]
      </pre>
      <p>
      The easiest thing to do is just to reattempt to update the flash, by
      running <code>colorhug-flash</code> again.
      If this again fails, just manually boot the firmware like this:
      </p>
      <pre>
      $ colorhug-cmd boot-flash
      $ colorhug-cmd set-flash-success 1

       I can't do native device drivers myself, although a few people have said
       informally they wanted to work on them.

      Due to miscommunication between myself and the ArgyllCMS maintainer,
      ArgyllCMS 1.5.0 and 1.5.1 only works with newer versions of the firmware.
      The 1.2.0 pre-release firmware adds Win32 and limited OS-X support to the
      device, but to do this we had to slightly change the communication
      protocol between the host and the device.
      The <a href="http://www.argyllcms.com/Argyll_dev_src.zip">development release</a>
      (what will become 1.6.0) of ArgyllCMS supports both old and new firmware
      versions, but if you need to use the latest released version of ArgyllCMS
      you need to do something like this:
      </p>
      <pre>
wget http://hughski.com/downloads/colorhug/firmware/colorhug-1.2.0.bin
colorhug-flash --filename colorhug-1.2.0.bin

      <a name="measure-modes"></a><h2>What's the difference between measurement modes?</h2>
      <p>
      There are only two ways of measuring the output of a light-to-frequency
      device, measuring the pulse width or measuring the number of pulses over
      a set time.
      </p>
      <p>
      The simplest way is to measure the number of pulses in a set time interval.
      This works well when the light level is high so that the quantisation
      noise is small but does not work well for very dark patches.
      Although an adaptive algorithm is used (giving dark patches more time),
      this sample speed is typically half of the pulse-width mode.
      This mode is the only available mode on firmware versions 1.1.x.
      </p>
      <p>
      Averaging several pulse durations has the advantage that it can work
      down to 0.5&nbsp;Hz, but as the reading gets high (0.5&nbsp;KHz and above)
      the measured readings begin to have small aliasing errors introduced.
      This mode is default on firmware 1.2.0 and newer, although the modes can
      be switched at runtime.
      In all tests so far, the 'duration' mode has outperformed the 'frequency'
      mode when building profiles.
      </p>
      <p>
      The two modes produce the same absolute readings and should not alter
      the reported absolute XYZ readings.
