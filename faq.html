<a name="leds"></a><h2>What do the LEDs mean</h2>
<p>
There are two leds in the ColorHug, one green and one red.
The LEDs are used in the following way:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Both LEDs flash on then off for a split second when the hardware is plugged in.</li>
<li>The green LED flashes quickly three times when the sensor is locked.</li>
<li>The red and green LEDs flash slowly alternately when the device is in bootloader mode and needs reflashing with new firmware.</li>
<li>The red LED displays morse code in the event of a fatal device error.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>
<a name="suckers"></a><h2>Why do I have to hold the device against the screen</h2>
<p>
Suckers have been known to damage LCD screens by lifting off the top layer
of glass.
I can't risk this kind of damage, as there's simply not enough profit in
each ColorHug to refund the repair costs of displays.
When calibrating each ColorHug I use a large rubber band to hold the device
to the screen. This works suprisingly well.
If you've got a good idea that doesn't involve suckers, please let us know!
</p>

<hr/>
<a name="crapcal"></a><h2>Why is my screen "wrong" after calibrating</h2>
<p>
If your screen differs much from the idealized sRGB that the ColorHug
is calibrated against then the calibration result may be far from ideal.
This may happen if you are using an expensive LED display, or a
minature embedded LCD with low bit depth DAC.
</p>
<p>
To fix this, you just need to load a correction matrix that's close to
your display technology using the <code>colorhug-ccmx</code> GUI program.
At the moment there are not many display types, but this will increase
when those in the ColorHug community with a photospectrometer start
contributing matrices. It's a typical chicken and egg problem, although
if you join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/colorhug-users" target="_blank">colorhug-users</a>
google group I'll announce new matrices when they are uploaded.
</p>
<p>
If you've already got a photospectrometer (or can borrow one for a few
hours) then please follow the directions <a href="calibrate.html">here</a>.
If you contribute the resuling CCMX file back to us, we can share it with
other users and improve their calibration result too.
I'm especially interested in odd display types, as these will be very
different from the calibration target.
</p>

<hr/>
<a name="remote-disable"></a><h2>What is lost-or-stolen mode?</h2>
<p>
When we send the ColorHug device to you, we give you the choice of
postage methods, as we understand a lot of people don't want to pay
&pound;9 postage for an item that only costs &pound;48.
Using untracked postage means that packages can get lost during tracking,
and due to the distance selling regulations of the UK, any lost packages
have to be refunded by the seller to the buyer.
</p>
<p>
In order to deter unscrupulous buyers, any packages that
are registered as lost or stolen will have the ColorHug devices added
to a blacklist.
This means that anybody trying to update the firmware on a device that
is registered as lost or stolen will have the hardware disabled.
Serial numbers will not be added to this list for any other reason.
</p>

<hr/>
<a name="firmware-update-data"></a><h2>What data is transmitted to hughski.com?</h2>
<p>
If you choose to update the firmware on your device, the <code>colorhug-flash</code>
program contacts <code>hughski.com</code> and downloads the list of all
the firmware updates. When it does that, the following data is sent to
the server:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Your IP address</li>
<li>The current version of the firmware</li>
<li>The hardware version of the device</li>
<li>The serial number of the device (e.g. #000337)</li>
</ul>
<p>
We don't actually use this data for anything other than working out what
firmware is available to you and any logs are automatically overwritten
after 30 days.
</p>
<p>
The <b>only</b> time any data is transfered to the server is when you
update the firmware or download new CCMX matrices, and certainly not
for each calibration or sample!
</p>

<hr/>
<a name="erase-factory-cal"></a><h2>I've erased my factory calibration!</h2>
<p>
If you're got colorhug-client 0.1.4 or newer installed, just run
<code>colorhug-ccmx</code> and you should be presented with the following
dialog:
</p>
<img src="img/colorhug-ccmx-fix.png" class="centered" alt="[colorhug-ccmx screenshot]"/>
<p>
Then just click <code>Repair</code> and the device will be back to normal.
</p>
<p>
If you're running an older version of the colorhug tools, simply
find the correct ccmx file from the <a href="http://www.hughski.com/downloads/colorhug/archive/" target="_blank">archive</a>
and perform the following steps:
</p>
<pre>
[user@localhost ~]$ /usr/libexec/colorhug get-serial-number
000043
[user@localhost ~]$ /usr/libexec/colorhug set-calibration-ccmx 0 ./calibration-000043.ccmx
[user@localhost ~]$ /usr/libexec/colorhug set-calibration-map 0 0 0 0 0 0
[user@localhost ~]$ /usr/libexec/colorhug write-eeprom "Un1c0rn2"
</pre>

<hr/>
<a name="payment-methods"></a><h2>What payment methods are accepted?</h2>
<p>
The preferred way of paying for a device is using Paypal as it's easy
for me to track payments and issue refunds.
If you've got ideological problems with Paypal, or would rather not
use them, then email me when you get the offer to purchase a device
and I'll give you my IBAN and BIC numbers for a direct bank transfer.
</p>

<hr/>
<a name="bugzilla"></a><h2>I've found a bug or missing feature, what do I do?</h2>
<p>
Just file a bug in our <a href="bugzilla/">bugzilla</a> issue tracker.
Be sure to write as much detail as possible in the bug report.
</p>

<hr/>
<a name="shipping"></a><h2>I sent money for a device over two weeks ago, where is it?</h2>
<p>
Normally shipping parcels to Europe takes about 4 working days, but has
been known to take up to two weeks, especially to Italy for some reason.
Shipping to Africa, Brazil and Russia is meant to take about one week,
but it seems parcels seem to get lost for weeks at a time and then turn
up without explaination.
If the destination is the United States, then make sure you're not got
a letter from the post office about a held package that has to pay some
kind of customs charge or sales tax.
</p>
<p>
If you've been waiting over two weeks then email me and I can confirm
the date I sent the parcel and the serial number.
Our policy on lost or missing parcels is this (which is based on how
quickly I can file a claim with the UK post office):
</p>
<ul>
<li>If the package was <i>signed-for</i> then we have to wait 6 weeks from the sent date</li>
<li>If the package was not <i>signed-for</i> then we have to wait 12 weeks from the sent date</li>
</ul>
<p>
If the parcel has not arrived up in the durations above, then I can either
(at your choice) offer you a refund of the full amount via paypal or
send another parcel <b>to a different address</b>.
If this second delivery also fails, then I can't attempt to send any more,
and only a refund will be offered.
</p>
<p>
If a refund is issued, or a replacement sent, then the original device
will be disabled to stop any unscrupulous postal workers from putting
the device on ebay. :)
</p>

<hr/>
<a name="flashing-failed"></a><h2>Flashing failed, is my device now a brick!?</h2>
<p>
No.
If the flashing failed (of if the new firmware is bad), the ColorHug
device reverts to a safe startup mode.
The bootloader is always loaded at every startup, and the firmware is
only bootstrapped if it is marked as valid.
The easiest way to tell if you are in bootloader mode is to
<a href="#leds">look at the LEDs</a> or search for a line like this in
<code>dmesg</code>:
</p>
<pre>
[  276.933714] generic-usb 0003:04D8:F8DA.0003:
  hiddev0,hidraw0: USB HID v1.11 Device [Hughski Ltd. ColorHug (bootloader)]
</pre>
<p>
The easiest thing to do is just to reattempt to update the flash, by
running <code>colorhug-flash</code> again.
If this again fails, just manually boot the firmware like this:
</p>
<pre>
$ /usr/libexec/colorhug boot-flash
$ /usr/libexec/colorhug set-flash-success 1
</pre>
