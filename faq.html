<a name="leds"><h2>What do the LEDs mean</h2></a>
<p>
There are two leds in the ColorHug, one green and one red.
The LEDs are used in the following way:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Both LEDs flash on then off for a split second when the hardware is plugged in.</li>
<li>The green LED flashes quickly three times when the sensor is locked.</li>
<li>The red and green LEDs flash slowly alternately when the device is in bootloader mode and needs reflashing with new firmware.</li>
<li>The red LED displays morse code in the event of a fatal device error.</li>
</ul>

<a name="suckers"><h2>Why do I have to hold the device against the screen</h2></a>
<p>
Suckers have been known to damage LCD screens by lifting off the top layer
of glass.
I can't risk this kind of damage, as there's simply not enough profit in
each ColorHug to refund the repair costs of displays.
When calibrating each ColorHug I use a large rubber band to hold the device
to the screen. This works suprisingly well.
If you've got a good idea that doesn't involve suckers, please let us know!
</p>

<hr/>
<a name="crapcal"><h2>Why is my screen "wrong" after calibrating</h2></a>
<p>
If your screen differs much from the idealized sRGB that the ColorHug
is calibrated against then the calibration result may be far from ideal.
This may happen if you are using an expensive LED display, or a
minature embedded LCD with low bit depth DAC.
</p>
<p>
To fix this, you just need to load a correction matrix that's close to
your display technology using the <code>colorhug-ccmx</code> GUI program.
At the moment there are not many display types, but this will increase
when those in the ColorHug community with a photospectrometer start
contributing matrices. It's a typical chicken and egg problem, although
if you join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/colorhug-users">colorhug-users</a>
google group I'll announce new matrices when they are uploaded.
</p>
<p>
If you've already got a photospectrometer (or can borrow one for a few
hours) then please follow the directions <a href="calibrate.html">here</a>.
If you contribute the resuling CCMX file back to us, we can share it with
other users and improve their calibration result too.
I'm especially interested in odd display types, as these will be very
different from the calibration target.

<a name="remote-disable"><h2>What is lost-or-stolen mode?</h2></a>
<p>
When we send the ColorHug device to you, we give you the choice of
postage methods, as we understand a lot of people don't want to pay
&pound;9 postage for an item that only costs &pound;48.
Using untracked postage means that packages can get lost during tracking,
and due to the distance selling regulations of the UK, any lost packages
have to be refunded by the seller to the buyer.
</p>
<p>
In order to deter unscrupulous buyers, any packages that
are registered as lost or stolen will have the ColorHug devices added
to a blacklist.
This means that anybody trying to update the firmware on a device that
is registered as lost or stolen will have the hardware disabled.
Serial numbers will not be added to this list for any other reason.
</p>

<hr/>
<a name="firmware-update-data"><h2>What data is transmitted to hughski.com?</h2></a>
<p>
If you choose to update the firmware on your device, the <code>colorhug-flash</code>
program contacts <code>hughski.com</code> and downloads the list of all
the firmware updates. When it does that, the following data is sent to
the server:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Your IP address</li>
<li>The current version of the firmware</li>
<li>The hardware version of the device</li>
<li>The serial number of the device (e.g. #000337)</li>
</ul>
<p>
We don't actually use this data for anything other than working out what
firmware is available to you and any logs are automatically overwritten
after 30 days.
</p>
<p>
The <b>only</b> time any data is transfered to the server is when you
update the firmware or download new CCMX matrices, and certainly not
for each calibration or sample!
