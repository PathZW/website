      <p>
       The gasket upgrade replaces the small triangle feet on the base of your
       ColorHug device.
       As we developed the ColorHug we got a few reports from people saying the feet
       were compressed during storage or shipping and that the ColorHug was not
       held completely flat against the screen even with the HugStrap.
       This sometimes affected the calibration result in a small way on some displays.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the ColorHug project has made a small profit, we've had an expensive custom foam
       punch made, and got 1000 closed cell foam gaskets cut as a sample run.
       We're offering the new gaskets as a way people can upgrade the triangle feet 
       to the new and improved design that is used with all the new devices.
      </p>

      <p>
       This is only available to people who have already bought a ColorHug,
       as orders over 1856 (or device serial numbers greater than 1800) have the new
       and improved gasket fitted as standard.
       The price you pay here is just the shipping cost, the actual gasket is
       free to previous customers.
      </p>
      <p>
       To fit the new gasket, simply pull off the feet of your device.
       You can then remove the adhesive backing on the gasket and apply it to the
       device.
       If you get it wrong, you can reposition the gasket once or twice if you are
       careful.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the ColorHug works fine, and the triangular feet protrude so the unit does
       not rock when you calibrate you probably don't need the new gasket at all.
      </p>

      <p>
       If you also want a free HugStrap, see this <a href="buy-hugstrap.html">page</a>
       as you get a free gasket with the HugStrap, although the postage is £1 more
       as the parcel is bigger.

      <p>
      Existing customers can get a complimentary gasket, but will be asked
      to pay £2.50 towards the postage and packaging cost.
      For simplicity, this is a flat rate for anywhere in the world.
      If you live near London, you're welcome to pick one up without charge,
      although by prior arrangement please.
