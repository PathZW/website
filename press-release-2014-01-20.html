      <p><b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</b></p>
      <br/>
      <h1>Hughski Ltd announces new OpenHardware ColorHug+ device</h1>
      <h2>Monday January 20th, 2014</h2>
      <p>
       London, UK &mdash; Hughski Limited announced this week that it is producing a
       new ColorHug+ device that is able to accurately profile displays and printers.
       It is planned an upgrade to the original ColorHug device that was only
       capable of profiling some types of display.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hughski Limited has announced this new product after the success of the
       original ColorHug device.
       The new product is based on an custom-designed OpenHardware
       mini-photospectrometer and is able to capture all colors from 400nm to
       800nm at 5nm-or-better resolution.
       A switched UV illuminant also allows paper fluorescence to be measured.
       All electrical, hardware, bootloader and firmware will be available for
       free with OpenHardware-approved licences.
      </p>
      <p>
       This device will allow artists, animators and photographers who use Linux
       to have absolute confidence in the colors that are shown on the screen and on paper.
       At the moment only a prototype device exists, but design of the optical
       unit for production has started and the first production batch is expected
       in the next 9 months.
      </p>
      <p>
       More information is expected to be released in due time, but some initial
       specifications have been listed <a href="http://www.hughski.com/colorhugplus.html">on the website</a>.
       Richard is asking anyone interested in purchasing a device to send an
       email to <code>info@hughski.com</code> with <code>[preorder]</code> in the title.
       The expected recommended retail price is currently Â£300, but that may be
       reduced if enough orders are received before production starts.
      </p>
