        We've run out of stock, and we're really sorry.
        We've expecting a new batch of PCBs from the fabricators on the 4th
        February and it'll take us a couple of days after that to complete all
        the assembly and testing.
        If you <a href="mailto:info@hughsie.com">send us an email</a> with
        <i>ColorHug Order</i> as the subject we'll email you when the next
        batch is ready to ship.
        Sorry for the inconvenience.

      The LiveCD also deliberately has no installer, so should be very safe.
      </li>
      <li>
      You will have to pay any applicable customs charges or import taxes when
      we send the ColorHug to any country which is outside of Europe.
      The label will state the value of the object is £60 and is described as
      <i>Color calibration hardware</i>.
