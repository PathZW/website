<p>
 We are a small company and unfortunately we don't directly accept
 credit cards, checks, bankers drafts or cash.
 Please use PayPal to complete the purchase.
</p>
<p>
 There is no long legal terms and conditions pages to read.
 Instead I've tried to cover the basics here.
 Please <b>only</b> order this product if:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You agree Hughski Ltd. can't be held responsible if your computer is
damaged or stops working after using the LiveCD or ColorHug.
Note: The ColorHug is a 5 Volt USB dongle with no screen suckers, so it is
highly unlikely to cause damage of any kind.
The LiveCD also deliberately has no installer, so should be very safe.
</li>
<li>
You accept that it's not quite finished for a plug and play experience.
The hardware is finished and the design isn't going to change, but you
will have to update the firmware in the future to fix bugs and add
features.
</li>
<li>
The device comes with only one general purpose calibration matrix,
although you can profile the ColorHug with a photospectrometer to get
a perfect calibration result.
As other CCMX matrices are contributed by users you can of course use the
<code>colorhug-ccmx</code> GTK program to automatically load on updated and
new calibration matrices to the device to make your calibration result more
accurate.
</li>
<li>
You will have to pay any applicable customs charges or import taxes when
I send the ColorHug to any country which is outside of Europe.
The label will state the value of the object is £60 and is described as
<i>Color calibration hardware</i>.
</li>
<li>
You agree that if packages are returned to me due to unpaid customs
charges, underpaid postage, incorrect address given or any other reason
then you are only entitled to a refund minus the charges it costs me
to accept the returned parcel.
</li>
<li>
The address the device is posted to must be a normal domestic or
business address.
We can't post Colorhug devices to any <i>Packstation</i> outlets in
Germany or <i>PO Box</i> addresses in the UK as packets have frequently
gone missing.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
 <b>
  PLEASE NOTE: We do not take your contact and shipping details directly
  from you, because we get them from PayPal.
  During the Payment process, PayPal will ask you to confirm this information.
  Please remember to check the shipping address that PayPal shows you
  during the payment process.
